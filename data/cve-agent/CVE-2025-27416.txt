Title: Asking For Scratch Username And Password

Description
Scratch-Coding-Hut.github.io is the website for Coding Hut. The website as of 28 February 2025 contained a sign in with scratch username and password form. Any user who used the sign in page would be susceptible to any other user signing into their account. As of time of publication, a fix is not available but work on a fix is underway. As a workaround, users should avoid signing in.
